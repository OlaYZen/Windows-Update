# **WIKI**
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/OlaYZen/Windows-Update/wiki), There could be some info you want to know

# **NEW UI**
New UI in development, We expect the new UI will be in the new [Preview](https://github.com/OlaYZen/Windows-Update/blob/Preview/Script%20PREVIEW.ps1) Build comming out later this week. [easiexd](https://github.com/easiexd) is currently in works to make a new ui. We will also try to not make it look like a program from the 1990's and try to get more of a modern feeling of the UI. Just like basically every program using Windows 11

# **Docs**
We will also make a Document of every features and how to use them, but this can take a while before is done. so don't expect the documents to be done this week
